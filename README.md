# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis I've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I had created in a past project. 

Built individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
